# S-P500-stocks-predictions
Basically , this repository provides a machine learning model to predict the stock prices of companies listed in the S&P 500 index. The code uses historical market data to train the model and make future price predictions. This project is intended for financial enthusiasts, data analysts, and developers interested in stock market prediction using machine learning.

---
#Major Features -

- Preprocessing of historical stock data.
- Feature engineering to capture meaningful patterns.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest, or XGBoost).
- Stock price prediction with visualization of results.
- **Backtesting**: Evaluate model performance by comparing predicted values with actual historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize trends, predictions, and stock price patterns.

#Process of Installation-

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the command below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes common libraries such as:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
- `tensorflow` (if using deep learning models like LSTM).
- `yfinance` to fetch historical stock market data.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the repository effectively:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sp500-stock-predictions.git
cd sp500-stock-predictions
```

### 2. Fetch Data with yFinance**

The `yfinance` library is used to fetch historical stock data. Run the `data_fetcher.py` script to download data for S&P 500 stocks using Yahoo Finance API:

```bash
python data_fetcher.py
```

**Main Function:**
- `fetch_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date)`: Downloads data for the specified stock symbol and time range. Saves the data as a CSV file in the `data/` directory.

**What is yFinance?**
- `yfinance` is a Python library that provides an easy interface to download historical market data directly from Yahoo Finance. It is widely used for fetching stock prices, volume, and other financial metrics.

Example:
```python
from data_fetcher import fetch_stock_data
fetch_stock_data("AAPL", "2015-01-01", "2023-01-01")
```

### **3. Preprocess Data**

Use the `preprocess.py` script to clean and prepare the data:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

**Main Function:**
- `preprocess_data(filepath)`: Cleans and normalizes the stock data, handles missing values, and splits the data into training and testing sets.

Example:
```python
from preprocess import preprocess_data
train_data, test_data = preprocess_data("data/AAPL.csv")
```

### **4. Backtesting the Model**

**What is Backtesting?**
Backtesting involves testing the performance of a predictive model on historical data to evaluate its accuracy and reliability. By comparing the model's predictions with actual historical stock prices, you can determine its effectiveness.

The backtesting process is integrated into the training and prediction workflows. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are calculated to quantify model performance.

Run the `train_model.py` script to train the machine learning model and perform backtesting:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### **5. Train the Model**

Run the `train_model.py` script to train the machine learning model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

**Main Function:**
- `train_model(train_data, model_type='lstm')`: Trains a specified model (default: LSTM). Supports other options like Random Forest (`rf`) or XGBoost (`xgb`).

Example:
```python
from train_model import train_model
model = train_model(train_data, model_type='xgb')
```

### **6. Make Predictions**

Use the `predict.py` script to make predictions:

```bash
python predict.py
```

**Main Function:**
- `make_predictions(model, test_data)`: Uses the trained model to make predictions on test data and visualize results.

Example:
```python
from predict import make_predictions
predictions = make_predictions(model, test_data)
```

### **7. Data Visualization**

Data visualization helps to better understand trends, patterns, and model predictions. Run the `visualize.py` script to plot the predictions:

```bash
python visualize.py
```

**Main Function:**
- `plot_predictions(true_values, predicted_values)`: Visualizes the actual vs. predicted stock prices.
- `plot_trends(data)`: Plots historical stock trends for better insights into stock performance over time.

Example:
```python
from visualize import plot_predictions, plot_trends
plot_predictions(test_data["Close"], predictions)
plot_trends(test_data)
```
